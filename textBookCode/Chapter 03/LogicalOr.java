         Determine whether the user qualifies for the loan
         based on either income or time on job.

         Key Note:
         The condition compares salary >= 30000
         - 'salary' is a double
         - '30000' is an integer literal

         Java automatically promotes the integer to a double (30000.0)
         during the comparison to match the type of 'salary'.

         This is called *implicit type promotion*, and it's perfectly legal
         as long as no precision loss occurs in the context.

         The same happens for yearsOnJob >= 2 â€” '2' is an int,
         promoted to 2.0 for the comparison.

         This allows flexibility in writing clean conditional expressions
         without always having to explicitly write 30000.0 or 2.0.

         That said, using decimal notation (e.g. 30000.0) can
         improve readability when working with floating-point values.
